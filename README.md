# CRISIS
Computational explorations to make a distant reading of the sociotechnical imaginaries of healthcare in Colombia

The crisis of the Colombian healthcare system has been attributed to different factors such as political corruption, lack of resources and the weight of lawsuits demanding the inclusion of new and often high costly interventions. For supporters of the system’s model, the interference of high courts and legal decisions has been a key factor in the sustainability crisis, arguing that the additional cost of lawsuits is 1% of Colombian GDP (Jaramillo, 2011, Nuñez and Zapata, 2012). For critics of the system, the use of legal instruments by patients is a consequence of the limitations in the supply of health services. Lawsuits against the State (Writ of Protection, Tutela) have had an important impact on health care provision. This paper makes a distant reading (Moretti, 2006) of the discourses and epistemic frameworks developed by the Colombian Constitutional Court in the period 1992-2020.
